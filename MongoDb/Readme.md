# Mongo Db & Mongoose
> Mongoose is a object-document model module in Node.js for MongoDB
> Wraps the functionality of the native MongoDB driver, allows defining strong schema
> Exposes models to control the records in a doc
> Supports validation on save
> Extends the native queries

## Mongoose Models
```
Fixed types of documents. 
```

### Model Methods
```
Since mongoose models are just JavaScript object constructors
they can have methods and these methods can be added to a schema
```

### Model Virtual Properties
```
Not all properties need to be persisted to the database
Mongoose provides a way to create properties, that are accessible
on all models, but are not persisted to the database
And they have both getters and setters
```

### Property Validation
```
Mongoose developers can define
custom validation on their properties
```

## Mongoose Modules
